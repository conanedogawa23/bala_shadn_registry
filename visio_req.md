**PROJECT SCOPE SUMMARY**

This appears to be a **system cleanup and consolidation project** with these primary objectives:

1. **Clinic Consolidation**: Reducing from 12 to 6 clinics  
2. **Feature Simplification**: Removing entire pages (Schedule, Lab, Relations)  
3. **Data Cleanup**: Removing unnecessary fields and product codes  
4. **Report Optimization**: Streamlining reporting capabilities  
5. **Insurance Simplification**: Reducing insurance complexity

The requirements suggest a strategic refocus of the VISIO system, likely to:

* Reduce maintenance overhead  
* Simplify user workflows  
* Focus on core business operations  
* Eliminate redundant or underutilized features

This is a significant system refactoring project that will require careful planning to ensure data integrity and user adoption during the transition.
