# Shadcn UI Component Library

Welcome to our Shadcn UI component library! This library is built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a collection of reusable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. The components are built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Component Organization

Our components are organized into the following categories:

### UI/Inputs

## Getting Started

### Installation

These components are designed to be copied into your project, not installed as a dependency. This gives you full control over the components and their styling.

### Usage

```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>
  )
}
```

### Customization

All components are built with Tailwind CSS and can be customized by modifying their respective CSS classes or through Tailwind's theme configuration.

## Component Development Guidelines

When creating new components:

1. **Accessibility**: Ensure components meet WCAG accessibility standards
2. **Responsiveness**: Design components to work across different screen sizes
3. **Customization**: Allow for adequate customization through props
4. **Documentation**: Document props, variants, and provide usage examples

## Storybook Usage

This Storybook instance provides:

- Interactive examples of each component
- Documentation of available props and variants
- Code snippets for easy implementation
- Component playground for testing different configurations
